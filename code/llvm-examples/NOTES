To Assemble to LLVM Bitcode:
    llvm-as <inputfile.ll>

To Interpret:
   lli <inputfile.bc>

To Compile to .s:
   llc <inputfile.bc>

To Compile to Executable
   gcc <inputfile.s>
   Note: There is probably also a way to do this directly with llc,
         but there may be an advantge to keeping the .s output
         so we can use our exisitng makefile and linking system in GCC.
