General:
* Strip out Name node in CallFunc -> parallel structure with SLambda name handeling

LLVM:
* Detect void function types and use void call style and type
* Remove node-wide "phi" member from IfPhi AST class. It was not needed.
* Make WhileFlatPhi nodes match format of IfPhi nodes
* Generalize llvmCall nodes to take function pointers instead of names

x86:
* Make string handling nicer (like in LLVM)

HELPER:
* The helper function sling a lot of ints around. It woudl be best to make these
  longs for consistency with pyobjs
* Add GT, GE, LT, and LE functions for bigs
